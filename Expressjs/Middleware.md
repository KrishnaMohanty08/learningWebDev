# Express.js Routing Guide

## üìå What is Routing in Express.js?
Routing in Express.js refers to **defining URLs (endpoints) for your application** and handling requests made to those URLs using different HTTP methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.

Express allows you to **map URLs to specific logic** using route handlers.

## üöÄ Setting Up Express.js
To use Express routing, first install Express:
```sh
npm init -y
npm install express
```

Create a file `server.js` and add the following basic setup:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

## üî• Basic Routing Example
Routing is done using `app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)`, where:

- `METHOD` ‚Üí HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, etc.)
- `PATH` ‚Üí URL endpoint (`/`, `/about`, etc.)
- `HANDLER` ‚Üí Function that runs when the route is accessed

```js
// Home route
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello, World!');
});

// About route
app.get('/about', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Welcome to the About Page');
});

// Contact route
app.get('/contact', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Contact us at contact@example.com');
});
```

## üõ†Ô∏è What is Middleware in Express.js?
Middleware in Express.js is a function that executes **before** the request reaches the route handler and **after** the response is sent. It is used for **logging, authentication, error handling, parsing request bodies, etc.**

### Middleware Function Structure
A middleware function has **three parameters**:

```js
(req, res, next)
```

- `req` ‚Üí Request object  
- `res` ‚Üí Response object  
- `next` ‚Üí Calls the next middleware or route handler  

### Types of Middleware in Express.js
1. **Application-Level Middleware** (Runs for every request)
2. **Router-Level Middleware** (Specific to certain routes)
3. **Built-in Middleware** (e.g., `express.json()`, `express.static()`)
4. **Error-Handling Middleware** (Handles errors)
